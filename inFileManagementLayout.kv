            # 1. filters Property:
    	    #     •The filters property of FileChooserListView is a list of functions (or glob patterns) that are used to determine which files and directories should be displayed.
	        #     •Each function in this list is called for every item (file or directory) in the current directory being displayed.
	        # 2. Function Signature:
	        #     •The filter function must accept two parameters:
	        #     •directory: The path of the directory currently being processed by the FileChooserListView.
	        #     •filename: The name of the file or directory within that directory.
            # 3. Kivy automatically calls the filter function with these two arguments for each item in the directory.
